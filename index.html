Hi Caylee with a C,
</p>
<p>

Thank you for the note you gave me back at USC, I still have it. You and everyone else had been so kind to me when I definitely did not deserve it. I was not used to having people who I could talk to, and it reminded me of what it was like to have good friends. Back home I have friends, but they're my friends because of similar interests and echelon of skill. Make no mistake, I would not be friends with most of them if not for the need to be able to talk to someone about the topics of which I am interested in. I bring this up not for pity, but because I am aware of my own flaws. I am not a social person; I only had my girlfriend who I could talk to, not my "friends". I am not someone who will fit into a group like the one that existed at USC. You said so yourself, that you wouldn't be friends with me if not for the circumstance. I will disappear quickly and within a month or so I doubt you will ever think about me again. It is the fate I have accepted; I have lived through it before and become used to it. I could try and make an effort to stay in the group, but like every time I've attempted to do that in the first place, it is doomed to fail. This may not be the last message you see from me but will be the last for a while. I am not sad about this, I have resigned myself to this by being the person I am. Like my favorite musical song, "For Good," from Wicked says, "Who can say if I've been changed for the better? But because I knew you, I have been changed for good." You all have reminded me whats it's like to have real friends, and for that, I'm eternally grateful. By giving me a chance and your patience, you all have given me the greatest kindness you could. You, Lexy and Jake (and everyone else, to a lesser extent (fewer interactions with all of them)) taught me how to just be a kid and enjoy life, to realize that academics aren't everything. Thank you. I hope you remember me next time your drinking a strawberry banana milkshake. This won't necessarily be the last message, but don't expect it to be the first of many. I love all of you for what you've done for me as a person. Me disappearing has NOTHING to do with all of y'all, but instead all to do with me and the life that I've forced myself to live. Who knows, we may see each other at my wedding someday... but only if I get an invite to your's and Stefan's wedding ;). Don't do drugs Caylee with a C.
